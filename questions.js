Each corp has the same fixed number of brigades. EACH brigade contains 1,000 Ohioans. Each corp battles a different state, and the brigades of each corp attack the corresponding state independently. Brigades either win or lose an attack and each have the same percent chance of victory in an independent attack as the percent of the world's population that the Mongol invasions allegedly killed. (Assume that the population of Ohio in ) (Case 2:) A surprise coup d'etat in the governance of Ohio prior to the battle of Indiana causes a change of plans in Ohio's war strategies. Now, Ohio will swiftly engage in a battle with all 49 defending states at once, instead of just Indiana. Additionally, Ohio has realized that to secure stable control over the states once the war has ended, AT LEAST HALF the brigades of each corp must survive and win their independent attacks on their corresponding states. What is the percent chance that Ohio is unsuccessful in conquering the United States if at least half of the brigades of each corp must win their independent attacks? (Note: corps also battle each state independently, and must either win or lose each battle. Ohio prevails in conquering the US if every corp succeeds against every state--particularly when at least half of each of their brigades prevail.)\n","answer":2,"source":"SOAPS Invitational 22-23","number":60},{"question":"How many Science Olympiad medals have been given out at the National Tournament throughout the history of the competition?\n","answer":4,"source":"SOAPS Invitational 23-24","number":1},{"question":"For every LEGO brick on Earth, a copy of the Lord of the Rings trilogy gets printed out.

Darren challenges him with the following game. Darren starts by paying Eric 10^10 dollars, and Eric is to make make daily predictions about whether or not it will rain the following day. Eric is to do this for an entire year, after which Darren will calculate the difference between how many times it rained and how many times Eric said it would rain. We call this difference x, and then Eric must pay Darren x^10 dollars.
